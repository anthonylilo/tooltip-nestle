# Tooltip-nestle
This is a small explanation about what I did in the backend test.

*I used PHP V.7.4.33*
*Jquery 3.0 offered by Drupal*
*Drupal 9.0.0*

## What is the order of the folders:
* Add the *modules/glossary* folder to your modules path.
* Add the *themes/glossary* folder to your themes path.

After that we can move on to the next step.

## Install the module Glossary Tooltip:
![extend](https://github.com/anthonylilo/tooltip-nestle/assets/76402507/cd153a85-f1e9-4d28-8926-78fec52da9a6)

We have to look in the *Extend* navigation bar, which is the page where we can install the *Glossary Tooltip* module. Click on install and wait for the *success* message.

## Install the theme Glossary Tooltip:

We have to look in the *Appearance* navigation bar, which is the page where we can install the theme.

When we are in the page, we have to search for "Uninstalled themes" and install *Glossary 1.0.0* and set as default

This is just to load the custom styles and the js file where I created the functionality to read the HTML document and add the tooltip to the matching word.

## Glossary Tooltip module

In this module we have 4 routes:

1. /add-glossary
2. /glossary-list
3. /get-glossary
4. /glossary-term/{id}

Note: *get-glossary* return a json answer for the js file.

To see if everything works  let's create our first term! Go to "/add-glossary" and create a term. This is what the page looks like.
![form-glossary](https://github.com/anthonylilo/tooltip-nestle/assets/76402507/64a6a7c4-cb9d-4e41-a3d3-5a9d64613711)

We fill in the form with the title and its description. When you see the *success* message we will see the term creating in "/glossary-list"

In my case I created the definition of "Dramaturgo".

## Create a post
Now click on *Content* in the navigation bar to create the post, when the page reloads the content we have to see this button and we have to click on "+ Add Content"

I created Julio Verne post, let's see it!

And as we can see, the word *dramaturgo* is highlighted if you put your mouse over the word, a tooltip will appear.

When the description is longer than 100 characters, you can click on them and go the description term page.

When is has lees than 100 characters, you can l in the same way you can click on the highlighted word and go the description term page.
