# tooltip-nestle
This is a small explanation about what I did in the backend test.

*I used PHP V.7.4.33*
*Jquery 3.0 offered by Drupal*
*Drupal 9.0.0*

## What is the order of the folders:
* Add the *modules/glossary* folder to your modules path.
* Add the *themes/glossary* folder to your themes path.

After that we can move on to the next step.

## Install the Glossary Tooltip:
![extend](https://github.com/anthonylilo/tooltip-nestle/assets/76402507/cd153a85-f1e9-4d28-8926-78fec52da9a6)

We have to look in the *Extend* navigation bar, which is the page where we can install the *Glossary Tooltip* module. Click on install and wait for the *success* message.

In this module we have 4 routes:

1. /add-glossary
2. /glossary-list
3. /get-glossary
4. /glossary-term/{id}

To see if everything works  let's create our first term! Go to "/add-glossary" and create a term. This is what the page looks like.

We fill in the form with the title and its description. When you see the *success* message we will see the term creating in "/glossary-list"

In my case I created the definition of "Dramaturgo".

## Create a post
Now click on *Content* in the navigation bar to create the post, when the page reloads the content we have to see this button and we have to click on "+ Add Content"

I created Julio Verne post, let's see it!
