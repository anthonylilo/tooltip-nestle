# tooltip-nestle
This is a small explanation about what I did in the backend test.

*I used PHP V.7.4.33*
*The Jquery offered by Drupal for .js files*
*Drupal 9.0.0*

## What is the order of the folders:
* Add the *modules/glossary* folder to your modules path.
* Add the *themes/glossary" folder to your themes path.

After that we can move on to the next step.

## Install the Glossary Tooltip:
![extend](https://github.com/anthonylilo/tooltip-nestle/assets/76402507/cd153a85-f1e9-4d28-8926-78fec52da9a6)

We have to look in the *Extend* navigation bar, which is the page where we can install the *Glossary Tooltip* module. Click on install and wait for the *success* message and to see if everything works, put in the browser path "/add-glossary".
